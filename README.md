# EXPERIMENT 1: INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING
## I. Intended Learning Outcomes
#### In this experiment, the primary objective is to understand and apply basic codes and functions in Python programming for developing functional Python programs.
## II. Instructions
### Problem 1: ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
#### Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.
### Problem 2: EMOTICON PROBLEM
#### Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:
| Word          | Emoticon      | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Smile         |       :)      | 
| Grin          |       :D      |  
| Sad           |       :((     | 
| Mad           |      >:(      | 
### Problem 3: UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM
#### Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.
## III. Solution
### Problem 1: ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
#### In Problem 1, the objective is to sort a string alphabetically. To achieve this, string functions are used to read the word input by the user, and then this word will be sorted. The def sort_string function is then defined to arrange the input characters in alphabetical order, with ''.join() used to combine these sorted characters into a single string. The return statement marks the end of the function and provides the sorted string as output. Finally, the print function displays the original and the alphabetically sorted word.
###
_In summary, the required outcomes are as follows:_
#### 1. A function that takes a string as input.
#### 2. A function that will sort the word in alphabetical order.
#### 3. Display the original input and the sorted string to the user.

### Problem 2: EMOTICON PROBLEM
#### For the Emoticon Problem, the task is to replace specific words with corresponding emoticons. The code uses string functions to process the sentence that the user input. By defining a function with def and utilizing the .replace(), the function substitutes the specified words in the parentheses with their corresponding emoticons. Finally, the print function is used to display both the original sentence and the modified sentence with the words replaced by emoticons.
_In summary, the required outcomes are as follows:_
#### 1. Allow the user to enter a sentence.
#### 2. A function that will replace the specific words into their corresponding emoticons.
#### 3. Display the sentence with the replaced emoticons.

### Problem 3:  UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM
_In summary, the required outcomes are as follows:_
#### 1. Allow the user to input a list of numbers.
#### 2. A function that will separate the list into First, Middle, & Last.
#### 3. Display the First, Middle, & Last element of the list.
